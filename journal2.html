        <p>For Project 1, I want to design a website that represents the 
        five alter egos of David Bowie. The homepage will navigate to the 
        various alter egos including Ziggy Stardust (1972), Aladdin Sane (1973), The 
        Thin White Duke (1976), Pierrot (1980), and The Blind Prophet (2016).
        Each page will contain songs from each album that the alter ego portrays, along
        with a short description of how each persona was created and how the alter egos 
        influenced the albums made during that time period. My intent for this project is 
        to create a website that consists of animation, bright colors, bold black lines, 
        and groovy typography inspired by comic books from the 70s.</p>
